Jason Burke's Portfolio

## Description

This is my personal portfolio, with links to my github and email, as well as various projects that I have completed. When a user loads the application, they are presented with a photo, my name, and a description of who I am!

There is a section including my projects, where each project image links to the completed project.

My contact info, and a link to my resume, are included on the bottom of the website.

The site is mobile responsive, with the format of the site changing based on the width of their viewpoint.
